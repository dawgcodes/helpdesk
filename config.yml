        You're trying to use a command but it keeps failing? Well, it's probably not able to answer, but follow the steps below to fix this.

        **Reedroux now uses slash commands!**
        Make sure you're using commands as Discord now requires all bots to use them.
        Get started by typing and 

        **Reedroux still doesn't seem to answer?**
        The only remaining scenario in that situation is a problem either on Discord's or our side. Verify that Reedroux is not offline in your server. If it's offline, your best call would be to wait up to 5 minutes and see if Mewwme comes back online. If it's online, has all the required permissions, you should definitely get in contact with one of our support members.

      description: |
        No one likes laggy music, but that sometimes happens when listening to music bots on Discord. Here are some possible solutions to help you fix that.

        *What should I do?**
        First of all you should check your internet connection. Discord displays your last and average ping in the bottom left corner, just click on "Voice Connected" and verify that your ping is behaving stable (if the red graph is stuttering a lot that means it's not stable!) and the last as well as the average ping is below 250 milliseconds. If both of these indicators show that your connection is bad you should try and check your WiFi/LAN. Restarting your router could also clean up some problems.

        **You're on a 5ms ping and you can download GTA 5 in 2 minutes?**
        So your internet connection seems not to be the problem. In 95% of the cases where Mewwme is lagging Discord is having temporary issues with their voice servers. They normally just restart them at some point but you could force a switch to a different server in your region.[Try switching your server region](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500007645701-Voice-Regions-on-Discord-FAQ#h_01F3RXJ4YCHYS652ETKWJ499Y3) in order to get a new and fresh Discord voice server.

        **How do I create a request channel?**
        Make sure Reedroux is granted `manage server` permission then type </setup:1212169679510962226> with the `create` option then the bot will automatically create a special channel for song requests.

        ```Note: Do not delete any message(s) Reedroux created in order for me to work properly.```

        **How do I delete a request channel?**
        As before only in the options you can select `delete`.

        When trying to run certain commands, Reedroux may lack certain permissions. In such cases, Reedroux will refuse to run the command until these issues are resolved. It's important to note that these permissions are not optional; Mewwme requires them to perform the command.

        If you believe the bot has the necessary permissions, make sure to check the channel's role overrides. These overrides can modify role permissions in specific channels.

        If you are still unable to determine why Reedroux does not have the required permissions, consider giving Reedroux the Administrator permission. This should resolve any Discord permission issues.

      description: |
        In very uncommon cases, even with the 24/7 mode enabled, Reedroux may disconnect from the voice channel without someone using /stop or Discord's Disconnect button. Some of the most common causes and a potential fix are listed below.

        **24/7 mode is not enabled.**
        By default, Reedroux disconnects from the voice channel when it's empty in 3 minutes.

        **Fix:** Refer to "4. How to enable the 24/7 feature?" in the first help embed to enable the 24/7 mode.

        **Missing permissions.**
        Whenever Discord asks us to reconnect to a voice channel, either due to server restarts or an API outage, we double-check the bot permissions to make sure it can join and speak in the channel. If something is missing, you'll have to use </play:1133048634318012471> again to invite the bot to a different channel or the same one after adding the required permissions.

        **Fix:** Make sure to use the </play:1133048634318012471> commands to add the bot to the voice channel instead of moving it from a different one. By doing that, you'll ensure that the bot has all the required permissions to reconnect when needed.

        **Server Region issues.**
        In certain cases, some voice regions may experience network and stability issues that could prevent the bot from joining the voice channel.

        **Fix:** Switch to another voice region using the voice channel settings (choose the one closest to your country).

        **Something else went wrong.**
        If you've tried all of the above fixes and the issue persists, please type `report` or open ticket in support <@1071885408885014638>
